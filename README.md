## Web-based Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
Breast cancer is a disease that affects people all over the world and can be fatal. On the other hand, if identified early enough, this deadly disease will save many lives. Radiologists mammography images to determine the presence or absence of breast cancer. Machine learning techniques are used in bioinformatics, specifically for breast cancer diagnosis. This research 
tests the most widely used Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms with logistic regression and binary classification. In this analysis, the University of Wisconsin’s Breast Cancer Data 
Set (BCD) is used to predict Breast Cancer. This dataset takes a number of factors into account when diagnosing the presence or absence of breast cancer, as well as the stage of the disease. 
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a surgical technique that is used to locate the affected cells. Using the supervised machine learning algorithm, the proposed work achieved a best accuracy 
of 96.15 percent. As a result, our primary goal is to assist people in curing diseases at an early 
stage and allowing them to live peacefully.
## About
Early detection of the malignancy of a lump is the key to high probability of survival. Many imaging techniques have been developed for detection and possibility of cure and decrease the 
mortality rate due to breast cancer. Although Mammograms are one of the best tools for breast screening, there are other imaging techniques such as Breast Ultrasound and Breast MRI.
To facilitate accurate classification of images using Machine Learning algorithms, the data processing is divided into 3 stages, namely preprocessing, feature selection and classification. 
Feature selection is the most important stage in algorithm building. The dataset generally contains several features and feeding too many features decreases the performance of the 
algorithm.
## Features
Web-based breast cancer risk prediction holds significant promise for the future of healthcare. Here are some potential features and advancements:

1. **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Web-based platforms can offer personalized risk assessment by integrating individual health data, family history, genetic information (if available), and lifestyle factors. This can provide women with a more accurate understanding of their risk level.

**Machine Learning Algorithms**: Integration of advanced machine learning algorithms can enhance the accuracy of risk prediction models. These algorithms can continuously learn from new data and improve over time, providing more precise risk estimates.

**Interactive User Interface**: User-friendly interfaces with interactive features can help users input their information easily and understand the results effectively. Visualizations and explanations can aid in interpreting complex risk assessments.

**Risk Reduction Recommendations**: Web-based platforms can offer tailored recommendations for risk reduction strategies based on individual risk factors. This may include lifestyle modifications, screening recommendations, and preventive measures.

**Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Seamless integration with electronic health records can enable healthcare providers to access patients' risk profiles during routine visits. This facilitates informed decision-making regarding screening, prevention, and treatment options.

**Mobile Compatibility**: Compatibility with mobile devices allows users to access risk assessment tools anytime, anywhere. Mobile apps can provide convenient reminders for screenings, medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications.

**Genetic Risk Assessment**: Incorporating genetic testing results into risk prediction models can enhance accuracy, especially for individuals with a family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1/BRCA2).
